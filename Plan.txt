docs:
basic local setup of the 2 apps and how to run the tests
listen on 8080
API → http://localhost:8000/tasks
Web → http://localhost:8080/
dockerhub link: https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/s1natex/my-devops-cicd-demo/general


Future improvemnets points:
- Limitation in-memory only - restart of the backend will wipe all tasks
- move frontend to nodejs
- pre commit for python, docker , terraform -- sast dast, sca and secret scanning
- add auto tag bump to the pipeline (x.y.z)


Troubleshooting:
- nginx.conf - listen on 8080 (non-root cannot bind <1024)
==========================================================================================
- [x] - Create new Repo and connect to GitHub my-devops-cicd-demo
- [x] - create git ignore for the project
- [x] - create python api for a task list
- [x] - create front end that shows the tasks with tick boxes and the ability to add and remove tasks
- [x] - write unittests for both apps
- [x] - dockerize both apps
- [x] - apply best practices and dockerignore to the dockerfiles
- [x] - wrap with compose - run -run tests
- [x] - push initial images(tag x.y.z z=start) to dockerhub
- [x] - create pre commit for python, docker , terraform
- [] - create initial ci for the app build-test-push to dockerhub incrementally - apply best practices and optimizations
- [] - auth with the aws account locally
- [] - create terraform bootstrap for remote state and oidc for the repo and run it
- [] - create a simple ec2 deployment with terraform run and test localy(EBS storage attached to the EC2 will hold the database files, via Docker volume mounts)
- [] - create bash script to run on the ec2 and deploy the compose file (terraform user_data.sh) - test apply
- [] - create ci for terraform files to run exclusivly on the terraform folder - apply best practices and optimizations
- [] - integrate cd part for the deployment to aws(pipeline) - apply best practices and optimizations
- [] - create integration and e2e and add to pipeline - apply best practices and optimizations
- [] - run the pipeline and verify connectivity via browser
- [] - apply single main branch startegy where dev branch has the initial ci gate on pr; if passed it merges and main cicd runs with terraform ci first
- [] - list future improvemnets
- [] - Update readme with final instructions
- [] - Review final project files
